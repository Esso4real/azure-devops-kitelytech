Setting up an environment in Azure for a client in the US region with developers in the Asia region, ensuring access only via US servers, involves several steps. Below is a high-level guide to help you achieve this:

## Prerequisites:
### 1. Azure Subscription and Active Directory:
    - Ensure you have an Azure subscription that covers the US and Asia regions and Set up Azure Active Directory to manage user identities and access.

## Infrastructure Setup:
Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to define the infrastructure as code or Terraform
### 1. Network Infrastructure:
    - Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) in the US region and divide the VNet into appropriate subnets, such as one for US servers and another for Asia servers. Note: For best practices is always a good practice to create SubNets with more address space in case we need additional resources in the future. 
    - Use NSGs (firewall rules) to control traffic between subnets and enforce access rules. Allow access only from the US subnet to the Asia subnet, restricting access the other way, or allow access only from designated IP ranges, enhancing security, or consider using a VPN for secure communication between the US and Asia regions (optional).
    - Set up Azure Bastion in the US subnet for secure remote access to servers.
    - Provision Azure VMs in the US region and ensure VMs meet the hardware and software requirements for Asp.Net 4.8 app.
    - Choose appropriate VM sizes based on the client's requirements for performance.
    - Create a storage account for storing development artifacts and backups.

### 2. Access Management:
    - Integrate Azure AD with on-premises AD (if applicable) for user management.
    - Define RBAC roles and assign appropriate permissions to developers based on their responsibilities.
    - Use Azure Key Vault to securely manage and store sensitive information such as database connection strings and API keys.

### 3. Software and Tools Installation:
    - Provide developers in India with Azure Virtual Machines pre-configured with Visual Studio 2019 and necessary development tools. That is, Install Visual Studio 2019 on each VM for development purposes.
    - Set up an SMTP relay server and Configure necessary credentials and secure connections within Azure for handling Outlook-based email communication.
    - Install and configure SQL Server on VMs. Set up necessary databases and user accounts.
    - Use Service Endpoints or Private Links for services like App Services , databases, Redis, Storage, AKS, KeyVault, to avoid connecting these resource through the internet. 

### 4. Application Migration and Upgrade / DevOps Setup:
    - Upgrade the legacy ASP.NET application from version 4.3 to 4.8. This might involve code changes, library / dependency updates, and testing.
    - Utilize Azure Boards for work tracking, ensuring transparency and efficient project management.
    - Create an Azure DevOps project.
    - Use Azure DevOps for version control, continuous integration, and deployment. Create pipelines for automated builds and releases.
    - Store the upgraded code in a secure source code repository within Azure DevOps or use any other private SCM tool like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket.
    - Automate compilation and packaging of Asp.Net 4.8 application by building pipeline in Azure DevOps and Integrate automated testing for code quality and functionality.
    - Establish a release pipeline with stages for Dev, Test, Staging and Production.
    - Integrate approvals in critical stages.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging:
    - Set up Azure Monitor to track VM performance, application logs, and security events.
    - Configure Log Analytics to centralize logs for analysis and troubleshooting.

### 6. Compliance:
    - Ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations.
    - Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest to meet security requirements.

### 7. Testing and Validation:
    - Conduct UAT with the Asia (India) development team to ensure the environment meets project requirements.

### 8. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the environment setup, configurations, and troubleshooting steps and provide training sessions for the Asia development team on the new environment, tools, and processes.

By following these steps, you can set up a secure and segregated environment in Azure, allowing access only via US servers while meeting the development and communication needs of the client and developers in the US and Asia regions, respectively. Regular monitoring, maintenance, and adherence to best practices will contribute to the overall success of the project.
